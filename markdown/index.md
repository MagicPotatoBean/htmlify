# Hi! &#128075;

I'm Zoe, and this is my website where I show off some of the cool things I have made!

## The things I have made

I have many projects, most available on my [github account](https://github.com/MagicPotatoBean), some much better than others, but here are some of the ones I am most proud of:
- [HTML-ify](htmlify.html), the tool I made so that I could have consistent formatting on all of my pages by converting markdown into stylised HTML (I wrote this page in pure markdown and used htmlify to turn it into html!)
- [Host](host.html), a [rust-script &#x1F517;](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-users-you-can-fearlessly-start-using-rust-scripts-already/35521/4) program which can take a list of files and a list of addresses, and will run a basic HTTP server to share these files for you.
- [Scriptify](https://github.com/MagicPotatoBean/Scriptify), another [rust-script &#x1F517;](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-users-you-can-fearlessly-start-using-rust-scripts-already/35521/4) program which takes a cargo workspace and converts it into a single rust-script file (including dependancies and multi-file programs).
